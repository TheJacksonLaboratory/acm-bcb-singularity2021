# Using Containers

There are many advantages in using containers. In the relm of scitenific computation containers facilitate scaleable acritcutres that are flexable.

Containers support many scientific disiplines and have established repositories that can be utilized. 

## Docker/Singularity Hub

https://hub.docker.com/ 
https://singularityhub.github.io/ 

Vast collection of containers that will provide solutions across:

1) Biology
2) Chemistry
3) Math/Statisics
4) Programming Languages.
...


Build a container to suit your needs.
	Include only the software and data that is needed.
        Compnenets in the os the system is built upon won't change.


Install specific software versions.
	Version of releases are important for reproducability of results.
        Stability of pipelines.


It provides integration to cloud pipelines. It is used as the core of the compuational backend of the pipeline, providning the operating system and specific alorithims to impliment. 
In either cloud or other HPC enviroements workflow managers are employed to describer and control entire workflows of data and computations

### Nextflow example

The integration for Singularity follows the same execution model implemented for Docker. You wonâ€™t need to modify your Nextflow script in order to run it with Singularity. Simply specify the Singularity image file from where the containers are started by using the -with-singularity command line option. For example:

```
nextflow run <your script> -with-singularity [singularity image file]  
```


The container will scale to the eniroment it is running in.
	# of cpu(s) available can be used without additional paramters being passed.
	Same would be true of RAM.
        Storage will be the login space with addtional storage made usable via bind.
