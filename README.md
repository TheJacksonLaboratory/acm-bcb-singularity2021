# Tutorial: Introduction to Application Containerization Using Singularity

[The 12th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2021)](https://acm-bcb.org/2021)

August 1-4, 2021 (Virtual)

## Overview

Containerization technologies (Docker, Singularity, etc.) are rapidly becoming an important tool to facilitate and encourage scientific reproducibility, and containers of computational tools and their dependencies are increasingly distributed as digital artifacts alongside manuscript publication.  While Docker is the de facto standard for software containerization in cloud computing environments, Singularity is rapidly emerging as the standard for containerization in large scale parallel and distributed computing environments, such as a typical high performance computing cluster at an academic institution.  In this tutorial, we will provide an introduction to containerization technologies in general, with a specific focus on Singularity and cover core features of using Singularity to containerize and execute computational biology and bioinformatics applications.  This will be a hands-on tutorial.  We expect participants will have a basic familiarity with the Linux command line and will be able to use their own laptops and SSH to connect to remote computing systems.
